# DOVE SIAMO: API, NOT REST

## MHW3 POLO FOTO
"Polo Foto" is a web application created for the mini-homework 3 of "Web Programming" with the aim to manage the online shop of a photographic print shop.

## DESCRIPTION
This web site is divided in 5 sections:
- Home: general view of the web site. There are the most popular photos of the shop.
- About us: info about the owner of the shop and the affiliated photographers.
- Products: the whole list of the products that the shop offers.
- Dove siamo: location oh the physical store.
- Carrello: info about the items that the costumer has saved and it's going to buy.

    ### DOVE SIAMO
    The "Dove Siamo" page shows a map obtained from **_"Bing Maps API"_**. This isn't a REST API but I inserted it anyway because it's useful for the page. 
    On the right side of the map there is a list with info & contancts about the shop.
