# ABOUT US: REST API

## MHW3 POLO FOTO
"Polo Foto" is a web application created for the mini-homework 3 of "Web Programming" with the aim to manage the online shop of a photographic print shop.

## DESCRIPTION
This web site is divided in 5 sections:
- Home: general view of the web site. There are the most popular photos of the shop.
- About us: info about the owner of the shop and the affiliated photographers.
- Products: the whole list of the products that the shop offers.
- Dove siamo: location oh the physical store.
- Carrello: info about the items that the costumer has saved and it's going to buy.

    ### ABOUT US
    The "About Us" page shows at the top of the section infos about the owner of the shop, then there is the whole list of the photographers that work for the shop.
    In this section I used the **_Spotify REST API_** with OAuth2.0 Authentication. Each photographer share his favorite playlist with the costumers that can see the title, 
    the image and can also listen it into Spotify by clicking the Spotify button.
