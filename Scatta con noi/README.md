# SCATTA CON NOI: REST API

## MHW3 POLO FOTO
"Polo Foto" is a web application created for the mini-homework 3 of "Web Programming" with the aim to manage the online shop of a photographic print shop.

## DESCRIPTION
This web site is divided in 5 sections:
- Home: general view of the web site. There are the most popular photos of the shop.
- About us: info about the owner of the shop and the affiliated photographers.
- Products: the whole list of the products that the shop offers.
- Dove siamo: location oh the physical store.
- Carrello: info about the items that the costumer has saved and it's going to buy.

    ### SCATTA CON NOI
    The "Scatta con noi" page is reachable from the Home Page by clicking its button. This is a page where the photographers give tips to the clients that are interest in
    particular kinds of photography. By **_YouTube API not REST_** I have included in the section of this page a Youtube video player with videos concerning photography.
    Also there is a section, created with **_IPGeolocation REST API with APIKey authentication_** where everyone can search information about a particular place in a
    particular day and see the position of the searched place in a map, introduced from **_Bing Maps API not REST_**
    
    **_YouTube API not REST_**: https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference
    **_IPGeolocation REST API with APIKey authentication_**: https://ipgeolocation.io/astronomy-api.html.
